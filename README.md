I am a [graduate student](https://geography.ua.edu/graduate-student/thapa-pawan/) in the [Department of Geography and the Environment](https://geography.ua.edu/) at the [The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa](https://www.ua.edu/). My research focuses on geographic information science (GIS), remote sensing, machine learning, and deep learning explicitly applying analysis, mapping, and modeling of rivers for width, centerline, direction, and discharge to estimate flood, erosion and ecosystem.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my PhD advisor (Dr. Lisa Davis) and everyone, whose continuous guidance and unwavering support have been instrumental from the inception to the completion and working continuously.
