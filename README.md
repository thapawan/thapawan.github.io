## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate graduate student at the [Department of Geography and the Environment](https://geography.ua.edu/) at the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/), focusing on the fascinating intersection of Geographic Information Science (GIS), Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning. My research explores river dynamics, flood risk assessment, and environmental modeling, leveraging cutting-edge geospatial technologies.

Previously, I had the privilege of lecturing at Kathmandu University, Nepal, and I hold the distinction of being the first Nepali to earn an M.Sc. in Geoinformatics from the University of Muenster, Germany.
